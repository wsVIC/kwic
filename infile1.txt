The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
My friend Bob loves to play basketball
In the summer, we like to go swimming
Reading books is a good way to gain knowledge
She sells seashells by the seashore
I love to travel and explore new places
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
To be or not to be, that is the question



A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step
Do not count your chickens before they are hatched
